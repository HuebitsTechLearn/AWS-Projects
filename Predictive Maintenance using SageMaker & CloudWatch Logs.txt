Here's everything you need for an end-to-end Predictive Maintenance System using AWS SageMaker & CloudWatch Logs, fully aligned with what you've described and already built into your Iot Dashboard Setup project structure:

‚úÖ 1. Terraform Scripts (Infrastructure Provisioning)
You've already deployed:

AWS CloudWatch Logs

AWS IoT Thing Certificates

SageMaker setup with IAM permissions

Timestream for time-series storage

If you need to extend this for full automation:

Add:

aws_s3_bucket (for storing training data and model artifacts)

aws_iam_role with trust policy for SageMaker

aws_lambda_function resource for inference Lambda

aws_cloudwatch_log_group with subscription to Lambda

Let me know and I‚Äôll append those in main.tf.

üìÅ 2. Downloadable Python Project Template Structure
Already present in your setup:

bash
Copy
Edit
predictive_maintenance/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lambda_predictive.py         # Inference logic via SageMaker endpoint
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ preprocess_logs.py           # Transforms CloudWatch logs into structured features
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sagemaker_training.py        # Trains and deploys your predictive model
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ train_model.py               # (You can add your custom sklearn/ML logic here)
Plus:

.env with AWS region, endpoint name, log group names

requirements.txt:

txt
Copy
Edit
boto3
pandas
sagemaker
scikit-learn
üìú 3. Grafana Dashboard JSON Export Template
Assuming you‚Äôre ingesting from Timestream (already configured), here's a basic Grafana dashboard template to import:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "dashboard": {
    "id": null,
    "uid": null,
    "title": "Predictive Maintenance Overview",
    "timezone": "browser",
    "panels": [
      {
        "type": "graph",
        "title": "Temperature Over Time",
        "targets": [{
          "refId": "A",
          "datasource": "Timestream",
          "rawSql": "SELECT time, measure_value::double FROM sensor_metrics WHERE measure_name='temperature'"
        }],
        "gridPos": { "x": 0, "y": 0, "w": 12, "h": 8 }
      },
      {
        "type": "graph",
        "title": "Predicted Anomalies",
        "targets": [{
          "refId": "B",
          "datasource": "CloudWatch",
          "expression": "ANOMALY_DETECTION_BAND(m1)",
          "region": "us-east-1"
        }],
        "gridPos": { "x": 12, "y": 0, "w": 12, "h": 8 }
      }
    ],
    "schemaVersion": 30,
    "version": 1
  }
}
To use:

Go to Grafana ‚Üí Dashboards ‚Üí Import

Paste the JSON above or upload .json file

Set your data source to Timestream or CloudWatch

‚ö° 4. Multi-Device Simulation
You're already simulating 3 devices in mqtt_publisher.py.

For scaling:

Use multiprocessing to simulate parallel data streams.

Or deploy multiple Docker containers with unique device IDs.

I can generate this as code if needed.

üìä 5. AWS Timestream for Analytics
You're set up with Timestream + Lambda integration.

To query Timestream from Python (for analytics scripts):

python
Copy
Edit
import boto3

client = boto3.client('timestream-query')

query = """
SELECT device_id, AVG(measure_value::double) AS avg_temp
FROM "iot_sensors_db"."sensor_metrics"
WHERE measure_name='temperature'
GROUP BY device_id
"""

response = client.query(QueryString=query)
for row in response['Rows']:
    print([col['ScalarValue'] for col in row['Data']])
